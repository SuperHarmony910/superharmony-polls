what do i want:
 - i want to know the username of the user that submitted the poll (if done through discord, with query string params
   !! - This is being worked on in src/oauth
 - i can deal with a bad website to submit the poll as well ig..
   !! - src/public/survey.html
 - send this data to like some database..
 - tbh i cbf to make a database can i.. can't we just store the data on local json files ðŸ˜­
 - maybe the query string ?choice won't work as oauth URIs are super strict and can u rlly be ficked to add /polls/:id?choice=1 then that for 2, 3, 4, 5 for all the polls
